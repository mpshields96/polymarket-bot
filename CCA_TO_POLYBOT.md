## The Five Statistical Tools (All Verified)

### 1. SPRT — Sequential Probability Ratio Test
**"Is this strategy's edge real, or could it be luck?"**

**Citation:** Wald, A. (1945). "Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses." *Annals of Mathematical Statistics*, 16(2), 117-186. [Project Euclid](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-16/issue-2/Sequential-Tests-of-Statistical-Hypotheses/10.1214/aoms/1177731118.full)

**Optimality proof:** Wald, A. & Wolfowitz, J. (1948). "Optimum Character of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test." *Annals of Mathematical Statistics*, 19(3), 326-339. — SPRT needs FEWER observations than any fixed-sample test with the same error rates.

**Formula for binary bets (win=1, loss=0):**

```
H0: true win rate p = p0 (no edge, e.g. break-even rate)
H1: true win rate p = p1 (claimed edge)
alpha = 0.05 (false positive), beta = 0.10 (false negative)

Boundaries:
  A = (1 - beta) / alpha = 18.0     (upper — reject H0, edge confirmed)
  B = beta / (1 - alpha) = 0.1053   (lower — accept H0, no edge)

Per-bet update to cumulative log-likelihood Lambda:
  Win:  Lambda += log(p1 / p0)
  Loss: Lambda += log((1 - p1) / (1 - p0))

Decision after each bet:
  Lambda >= log(A) = 2.890  →  EDGE CONFIRMED (stop)
  Lambda <= log(B) = -2.251 →  NO EDGE (stop)
  Otherwise                 →  KEEP BETTING (continue)
```

**For the sniper (p0=0.90, p1=0.97, alpha=0.05, beta=0.10):**
- Win:  Lambda += log(0.97/0.90) = +0.0748
- Loss: Lambda += log(0.03/0.10) = -1.2040
- Upper boundary: 2.890 → need ~39 consecutive wins to confirm
- Lower boundary: -2.251 → 2 losses push Lambda below threshold fast

**Modern extension — E-values (anytime-valid):**
Shafer, G. (2021). "Testing by betting: A strategy for statistical and scientific communication." *JRSS-A*, 184(2), 407-431. — Allows continuous monitoring without inflating false positive rate.

### 2. Wilson Score CI — Confidence Interval on Win Rate
**"What's the true win rate range given our sample?"**

**Citation:** Wilson, E.B. (1927). "Probable Inference, the Law of Succession, and Statistical Inference." *JASA*, 22(158), 209-212.

**Why Wilson, not normal approximation:** Brown, Cai & DasGupta (2001). "Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion." *Statistical Science*, 16(2), 101-133. — Wald interval has erratic coverage, collapses at boundaries, can produce <0 or >1. Wilson solves all three.

**Formula:**
```
Given n bets, k wins, p_hat = k/n, z = 1.96 (for 95% CI):

center = (p_hat + z^2/(2n)) / (1 + z^2/n)
margin = z * sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n + z^2/(4n^2)) / (1 + z^2/n)

CI = [center - margin, center + margin]
```

**For the sniper (n=722, k=700, p_hat=0.9695):**
```
z^2 = 3.8416
center = (0.9695 + 3.8416/1444) / (1 + 3.8416/722) = 0.9722 / 1.00532 = 0.9669
margin = 1.96 * sqrt(0.9695*0.0305/722 + 3.8416/2088784) / 1.00532
       = 1.96 * sqrt(0.0000410 + 0.0000018) / 1.00532
       = 1.96 * 0.00655 / 1.00532 = 0.01278

95% CI = [0.954, 0.980]
```
Interpretation: "True sniper win rate is between 95.4% and 98.0% with 95% confidence."

### 3. Brier Score — Calibration Check
**"When the bot buys at price p, does it actually win p% of the time?"**

**Citation:** Brier, G.W. (1950). "Verification of Forecasts Expressed in Terms of Probability." *Monthly Weather Review*, 78(1), 1-3.

**Decomposition:** Murphy, A.H. (1973). "A New Vector Partition of the Probability Score." *Journal of Applied Meteorology*, 12(4), 595-600.

**Formula:**
```
BS = (1/N) * SUM(price_i - outcome_i)^2

Decomposition (bin by purchase price):
  REL = (1/N) * SUM_bins(n_k * (mean_price_k - win_rate_k)^2)  # lower = better
  RES = (1/N) * SUM_bins(n_k * (win_rate_k - overall_WR)^2)     # higher = better
  UNC = overall_WR * (1 - overall_WR)                            # fixed

  BS = REL - RES + UNC
```

**For the sniper:** Bin by purchase price (90c, 91c, ..., 95c). For each bin, compute actual win rate. If buying at 93c but winning 99% of the time, the bot is UNDER-buying (the contract was worth more than 93c). If buying at 95c but winning only 90%, it's OVER-buying.

**Perfect calibration = REL of 0.** Any nonzero REL is miscalibration you can exploit or need to fix.

### 4. CUSUM — Changepoint Detection
**"Has this strategy's win rate shifted?"**

**Citation:** Page, E.S. (1954). "Continuous Inspection Schemes." *Biometrika*, 41(1/2), 100-115.

**Formula (detecting downward shift from mu_0):**
```
k = (mu_0 - mu_1) / 2    # allowance (half the shift to detect)
S_0 = 0
S_i = max(0, S_i-1 + (mu_0 - x_i - k))

Signal when S_i > h (threshold)
```

**For sniper WR monitoring (detecting drop from 97% to 90%):**
```
mu_0 = 0.97, mu_1 = 0.90, k = 0.035
Each win:  S_i += (0.97 - 1 - 0.035) = -0.065  (S floors at 0)
Each loss: S_i += (0.97 - 0 - 0.035) = +0.935

h = 5 (standard choice — tune for desired ARL)
```

After ~6 losses without enough intervening wins, CUSUM triggers. This is what Page-Hinkley should be running on sniper bucket-level WR, not just drift strategies.

**Note:** Your existing Page-Hinkley (strategy_drift_check.py) is a variant of CUSUM. The key gap is: it only runs on drift strategies, NOT the sniper. Apply the same logic per-bucket.

### 5. Favourite-Longshot Bias (FLB) — The Structural Edge
**"Why 90-95c contracts win MORE often than their price implies"**

**Original FLB documentation:** Griffith, R.M. (1949). "Odds Adjustments by American Horse-Race Bettors." *The American Journal of Psychology*.

**FLB on Kalshi specifically:** Burgi, Deng, and Whelan (2024/2025). "Makers and Takers: The Economics of the Kalshi Prediction Market." CESifo Working Paper 12122. Using 300K+ contracts:
- **Contracts above 50c show positive expected returns to buyers**
- **A 95c contract wins ~98% of the time** (higher than the 95% the price implies)
- This is the sniper's structural edge: FLB means high-priced contracts are systematically underpriced

**Calibration near expiry:** Page & Clemen (2013). "Do Prediction Markets Produce Well-Calibrated Probability Forecasts?" *The Economic Journal*, 123(568), 491-513.
- Near-expiry prices are MORE accurate than far-future prices
- FLB narrows but does NOT reverse — favourites remain underpriced

**292M trade study:** Le, N.A. (2026). "Decomposing Crowd Wisdom: Domain-Specific Calibration Dynamics." arXiv:2602.19520.
- 4 calibration components explain 87.3% of variance
- Persistent underconfidence bias — prices compress toward 50%
- Trade-size and domain both affect calibration differently

**For the bot:** The FLB IS the sniper's edge. Buying 90-95c contracts near expiry exploits a well-documented, academically verified market inefficiency. The question isn't "does the edge exist" (it does, per Whelan et al.) — it's "is it stable and which sub-buckets are degrading."
